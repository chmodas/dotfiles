## Prerequisites
To achieve maximum interoperability, the following "dot files" setup is
intended for use with [tmux][]. On MacOS you can install it using *brew*. Most
Linux distributions package it.

Ideally, you would want to run [VIM 8][vim8].

The Hack font.

The font-awesome fonts (ttf and otf - https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/56899).

## Installation
Run the install.sh script.
